								<strong>Hello!</strong> You're looking at an artefact created with Open-source data which showcases London Air pollution levels across the road network
								in conjunction with e-scooter hire availability data. This map shows the severity or air pollution levels in line with the CAQI. If a route you are looking to 
								travel on is coloured orange or red, we would advise that you chose an alternative route or wear approprite air pollution filtering masks to reduce the risks to your health.
